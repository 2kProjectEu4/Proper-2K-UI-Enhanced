[h2][b]Overview[/b][/h2]
[b]Proper 2K UI Enhanced[/b] builds upon the original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2863086388]Proper 2K UI Project[/url] mod to better align with the original Europa Universalis IV interface design. Iâ€™ve cleaned up the project and organized the removed assets into submods for flexibility. Below, Iâ€™ve listed the types of new changes that [b]Xyarvius[/b] and I contributed to the mod:
[list]
    [*] Adjusted text and UI elements positioning for a more visually appealing layout, preventing overlap.
    [*] Enlarged several windows to better fit larger fonts.
    [*] Fixed most progress bar glitches.
    [*] Enhanced important UI windows, such as the Holy Roman Empire (HRE) and Emperor of China (EoC) windows.
[/list]

[h3]This is a standalone mod, so there's no need to download the original version.[/h3]

[h3][b]Will I make a 4K version of this mod?[/b][/h3]
[b]TL;DR:[/b] No, I don't see myself doing this.
[b]Long explanation:[/b] All the improvements I've made to this mod were done by playing the game, noting down everything that wasn't optimal, and eventually fixing them in my free time. There's no automation for this; everything was done manually. So even if I were to scale up the current version to 4K, there would still be a lot of work involved, and I can't invest my free time in doing it. 
[b]Later edit:[/b] You might want to try using this mod along with the gameâ€™s GUI scaling feature and adjust the scaling to a value between 1.2 and 1.3. Itâ€™s not a perfect solution, but it could help improve the overall experience.
