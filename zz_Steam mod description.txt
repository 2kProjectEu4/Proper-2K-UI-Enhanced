This mod enhances the existing [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2863086388]Proper 2K UI Project[/url] for an even better experience.
This is a standalone mod, so there's no need to download the original version.

[h2]Why does this mod exist?[/h2]
I modified the original Proper 2K UI Project mod over the past year to satisfy my need for perfectly aligned UI elements. I noticed the updates had stopped, so I decided to create an updated version that some of you might appreciate.

This mod addresses the text overlap and UI issues present in the original. I have scaled all EU4 assets up to version 1.37.2 to ensure compatibility and enhance your gaming experience. Additionally, I made numerous small adjustments to the UI elements for a more polished look and feel.

[h3]⚠️ To ensure the best experience, please activate all DLCs, as some bugs may arise without them. If you don’t have all the DLCs, feel free to share your configuration in the comments, and I’ll do my best to address any issues. Thank you! ⚠️[/h3]
