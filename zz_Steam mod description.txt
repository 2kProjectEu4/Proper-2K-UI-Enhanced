[h2]Why does this mod exist?[/h2]
I modified the original Proper 2K UI Project mod over the past year to satisfy my need for perfectly aligned UI elements. I noticed the updates had stopped, so I decided to create an updated version that some of you might appreciate.

This mod addresses the text overlap and UI issues present in the original. I have scaled all EU4 assets up to version 1.37.2 to ensure compatibility and enhance your gaming experience. Additionally, I made numerous small adjustments to the UI elements for a more polished look and feel.

[h3]✨✨ Huge thanks to [b]Xyarvius[/b] for bringing the Steam mod closer to perfection with all those fantastic quality of life changes! Your hard work and dedication are truly appreciated by the entire community. Keep up the amazing work! ✨✨[/h3]

[h3] ⚠️This mod works best when used with a 2560x1440 (QHD) resolution for optimal performance and visual quality. ⚠️[/h3]

[h3]⚠️ To ensure the best experience, please activate all DLCs, as some bugs may arise without them. If you don’t have all the DLCs, feel free to share your configuration in the comments, and I’ll do my best to address any issues. Thank you! ⚠️[/h3]

[h2]Will I make a 4K version of this mod?[/h2]

TL;DR: No, I don't see myself doing this.

Long explanation: All the improvements I've made to this mod were done by playing the game, noting down everything that wasn't optimal, and eventually fixing them in my free time. There's no automation for this; everything was done manually. So even if I were to scale up the current version to 4K, there would still be a lot of work involved, and I can't invest my free time in doing it. 

I can't speak for the changes [b]Xyarvius[/b] made.

[b]Later edit:[/b] You might want to try using this mod along with the game’s GUI scaling feature and adjust the scaling to a value between 1.2 and 1.3. It’s not a perfect solution, but it could help improve the overall experience.

[b]Tip:[/b] If you're bothered by the ledger's position, I've modified the code to allow the ledger to be moved by clicking its header.
