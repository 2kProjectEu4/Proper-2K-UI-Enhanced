This mod enhances the existing Proper 2K UI Project for an even better experience. It is a standalone mod, so there's no need to download the original version.


Why does this mod exist?
I modified the original Proper 2K UI Project mod over the past year to satisfy my need for perfectly aligned UI elements. I noticed the updates had stopped, so I decided to create an updated version that some of you might appreciate.
This mod addresses the text overlap and UI issues present in the original. I have scaled all EU4 assets up to version 1.37.2 to ensure compatibility and enhance your gaming experience. Additionally, I made numerous small adjustments to the UI elements for a more polished look and feel.

All credits go to "goondo" for their Scale_UI mod and "LuvianQ" for the original "Proper 2K UI Project."
